The token validation in CouponsAPI will work like this: the token parameters (secret/audience/issuer) will be defined both in AuthAPI and CouponsAPI. 
All parameters will be validated on authentication/authorization.
The token generated by AuthAPI will contain all the mentioned parameters and also the claims of type role.
When [Authorize(Role="Admin")] is used on CouponsAPIController, for example, aspnetcore identity will look for the claim of type Role with value "Admin" to validate the permission in the token
